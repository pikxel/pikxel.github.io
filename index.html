    <h1>Privacy Policy for Countdown Pro</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Countdown Pro ("we," "our," "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, Countdown Pro (the "App").</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Our App is designed to operate entirely on your device without any networking capabilities. As such, we do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data or information from external sources. The information you provide within the App, such as event titles, dates, and descriptions, is stored locally on your device and is not shared with any third parties.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
        <p>All data entered into the App, including but not limited to event names, dates, and descriptions, is used solely to provide you with the countdown functionalities and event management features. This data helps you keep track of your important events and milestones directly on your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose any of your personal information or App data to third parties. Since the App operates entirely offline and does not connect to any external servers or services, your data remains secure and private on your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement robust security measures to ensure that your data remains safe on your device. However, since the App does not utilize any online services or third-party integrations, all security is inherently managed by your device's operating system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have full control over the data you enter into the App. You can create, modify, and delete your events at any time. Since all data is stored locally, you are responsible for backing up your device to preserve your information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so we can take necessary actions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, and the "Effective Date" at the top will be updated accordingly. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
    </div>
